<h2>How to Access Website Optimization Project</h2>

<p> Click on link given on required project assets through udacity and download repository through git hub.

<p>First begin working on index.html. Open index.html in browser. As you make modifications in code keep refreshing browser to check your progress as you go. Opened index.html in text editor and first added picture of self in header and entered paragraph describing what project was about. Left examples of classes taken that came with repository. Then put style.css through minification generator to minify code. Always check developer tools along the way for site performance issues </p>

<p> Using https://compressor.io/compress compressed all images downloaded with repository <p>

<p> Clicked on views folder and opened up pizza.html in browser. Then opened up views/js/main.js in text editor and began to work on that. Here is were where I worked on getting the pizza's to load in less the 5 ms and getting the site run at 60 fps. Deleted function determine Dx because it was not necessary. Changed each case number by moving decimal point over two numbers to the right to change to percentage of his pizza size. Being that I took determine dx out that mines anything calling that function had to be taken out also and changed. Changing variable to randomPizzas and to make get faster used document.getElementsByClassName. I calculated the number of pizza's to full the screen by using the height property of the screen and the multiplying it by rows * cols. Then query.Selector the moving pizza's</p>
